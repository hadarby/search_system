[MAFALA, spoken]
In this part of Africa, we all have a saying - whenever something bad happens, we just throw our hands up to the sky and say HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Hasa Diga Eebowai?

[MAFALA. spoken]
It's the only way to get through all these troubled times. There's war, poverty, famine... but having a saying makes it all seem better!

(sung)
There isn't enough food to eat
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
People are starving in the street!

[UGANDANS, MAFALA]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Well, that's pretty neat!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Does it mean no worries for the rest of our days?

[MAFALA, spoken]
Kind of!

(sung)
We've had no rain in several days

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
And 80% of us have AIDS

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
Many young girls here get
Circumcised
Their clits get cut right off

[ALL]
Way oh!

[WOMEN]
And so we say up to the sky

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA, spoken]
Now you try! Just stand up tall, tilt your head to the sky, and list off all the bad things in your life!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
Somebody took our luggage away!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER PRICE]
The plane was crowded
And the bus was late!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
When the world is getting you down
There's nobody else to blame!

[UGANDANS]
Way oh!

[MAFALA]
Raise your middle finger to the sky
And curse his rotten name!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Wait, what?!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Am I saying it right?

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Excuse me sir, but what exactly does that phrase mean?

[MAFALA, spoken]
Well, lets see... "Eebowai" means "God". And "Hasa Diga" means... "f** You". So I guess in English it would be "f** you, God!"

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
What?!

[MAFALA]
When God f**s you in the butt

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
f** God right back in his cunt!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
f** you, God!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
f** you, God!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Excuse me, Sir, but you should really not be saying that. Things aren't always as bad as they seem!

[MAFALA, spoken]
Oh really? Well take this f**ing a**hole, Mtumbo here. He got caught last week trying to rape a baby!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
What?! Why?!

[MAFALA,spoken]
Some people in his tribe believe having s** with a virgin will cure their AIDS. There aren't many virgins left, so some of them are turning to babies!

[ELDER PRICE,spoken]
But that's horrible!

[MAFALA,spoken]
I know!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
Here's the butcher, he has AIDS
Here's the teacher, she has AIDS
Here's the doctor, he has AIDS
Here's my daughter, she has A
Wonderful disposition
She's all I have left in the world
And if either of you lays a hand on her
I will give you my AIDS!

[UGANDANS]
If you don't like what we say
Try living here a couple days
Watch all your friends and family die
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
(f** you!)
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

f** you God in the a**, mouth
And cunt-a
f** you God in the a**, mouth
And cunt-a
f** you God in the a**, mouth
And cunt-a
f** you in the eye!

Hasa
Diga Eebowai!
Hasa
f** you in the other eye!

f** you!
f** you God!
f** you!
f** you God!
f** you!
f** you God!

Hasa Diga!
f** you God!
In the cunt!
