[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
I'd do anything for you. I'm your best friend!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Well, alright then. Let's get some sleep, huh?

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Yeah...So tired...

(sung)
Sleep now, little buddy
Put your cares away
Nappy with a happy face
Tomorrow's a latter day

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
What are you doing?

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
I'm just trying to make you feel better!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
I feel fine.... but this is what I'm talking about, Elder. Our focus needs to be on our work. Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be? The missionaries here have yet to bring a single person to the church!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Well, if they had already baptized a bunch of Africans here then it wouldn't be so incredible when you did it, now would it?

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
I guess.... I guess that's kind of true...

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Don't forget what you told me! You are awesome! Together, we're gonna bring lots of Africans to the church! And then, my Dad will finally feel proud of me... instead of just feeling "stuck" with me

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
You know what, Elder? I think your dad's got plenty to be proud of right now

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Really?!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Yeah!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
Evening star shines brightly
God makes life anew!
Tomorrow is a latter day
And I am here for you

[ELDER PRICE]
I am here for you, too

[BOTH]
We are here
For us

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Goodnight, best friend!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Goodnight, pal
