[ELDER PRICE]
I've always had the hope
That on the day I go to Heaven
Heavenly Father will shake my hand and say
"You've done an awesome job, Kevin!"
Now it's our time to go out

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
My best friend -

[ELDER PRICE]
And set the world's people free
And we can do it together
You and me
But mostly me!

You and me - but mostly me
Are gonna change the world forever
Cause I can do most anything

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM:]
And I can stand next to you and watch!

[ELDER PRICE]
Every hero needs a sidekick
Every captain needs a mate

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
Aye aye!

[ELDER PRICE]
Every dinner needs a side dish

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
On a slightly smaller plate!

[BOTH]
And now we're seeing eye to eye
It's so great we can agree
That Heavenly Father has chosen
You and me -

[ELDER PRICE]
Just mostly me!

Something incredible
I'll do something incredible!
I want to be the Mormon

That changed all of mankind

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
My best friend -

[ELDER PRICE]
I'm something I've foreseen
Now that I'm nineteen
I'll do something incredible
That blows God's freaking mind!

[BOTH]
And as long as we stick together

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
And I stay out of your way -

[ELDER PRICE]
Out of my way!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
We can change the world

[BOTH]
Forever

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
And make tomorrow a latter day!

[ELDER PRICE]
Mostly me!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
So quit singing about it

[BOTH]
And do it
How ready and psyched are we
Life is about to change for you
And life is about to change for me
And life is about to change for you and me -

[ELDER PRICE]
But me, mostly!
And there's no limit to
What we can do
Me and you
But mostly
Me!
