I got a feeling
That you could be feeling
A whole lot better then you feel today
You say you got a problem
Well that's no problem
It's super easy not to feel that way

When you start to get confused
Because of thoughts in your head
Don't feel those feelings!
Hold them in instead

Turn it off, like a light switch
Just go click!
It's a cool little Mormon trick!
We do it all the time
When you're feeling certain feels
That just don't feel right
Treat those pesky feelings
Like a reading light

And turn 'em off
Like a light switch, just go BAP!
Really, whats so hard about that?
Turn it off!

[ELDERS]
Turn it off!

[ELDER CHURCH]
When I was young my dad
Would treat my mom real bad
Every time the Utah Jazz would lose
He'd start a-drinking
And I'd start a-thinking
How am I gonna keep my mom from getting abused?

I'd see her all scared and my soul was dying
My dad would say to me: "Now, don't you dare start crying" [ELDER MCKINLEY]
Turn it off [ELDERS] Like a light switch
Just go flick
It's our nifty little Mormon trick Turn it off Turn
It
Off [ELDER THOMAS]
My sister was a dancer, but she got cancer
My doctor said she still had two months more
I thought she had time, so I got in line
For the new iPhone at the Apple Store

She lay there dying with my father and mother
Her very last words were "Where is my brother?" [ELDER CHURCH] [ELDERS]
Turn it off Yeah! Bid those sad feelings adieu The fear I might get cancer too [ELDER MCKINLEY]
When I was in fifth grade
I had a friend, Steve Blade [ELDERS]
Oooh, Steve Blade He and I were close
As two friends could be We could be close One thing led to another

And soon I would discover Wow I was having really strange feelings for Steve I thought about us, on a deserted island We're all alone We'd swim naked in the sea
And then he'd try and... WOAH! Turn it off!
Like a light switch There it's gone Good for you! My hetero side just won!
I'm all better now
Boys should be with girls
That's heavenly father's plan
So if you ever feel
You'd rather be with a man
Turn it off! [ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Well, Elder McKinley, I think it's okay that you're having gay thoughts, just so long as you never act upon them [ELDER MCKINLEY] [ELDERS] No, because then you're
Just keeping it down Like a dimmer switch
On low On low Thinking nobody needs to know! Uh oh [ELDER PRICE]
But that's not true! [ELDER MCKINLEY]
Being gay is bad
But lying is worse
So just realize you have
A curable curse And turn it off Turn it off
Turn it off Turn it off! (The ELDERS dance.)

[ELDERS]
Turn it off!

[ELDER MCKINLEY]
Now, how do you feel?

[ELDER PRICE]
The same

[ELDER MCKINLEY]
Then you've only got yourself to blame
You didn't pretend hard enough
Imagine that your brain is made of tiny boxes
And find the box that's gay and CRUSH IT!
Okay?

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
No, no, I'm not having gay thoughts!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Alright! It worked!

[ELDERS]
Yay!
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off
Like a light switch just go click (click click!)
What a cool little Mormon trick! (trick trick!)
We do it all the time! [ELDER MCKINLEY]
When you're feeling certain feelings [ELDERS] That just don't seem right Don't seem right Treat those pesky feelings
Like a reading light A reading light Turn it off Like a light switch on a cord
Now he isn't gay anymore [ELDERS]
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it
Turn it

[ELDER MCKINLEY]
Turn it off!
